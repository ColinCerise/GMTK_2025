Nathan Stone: Howdy, how much of the “it” do you have in stock?
Employee: Dont worry sir we have a great selection sold in bulk by the pound or sold by the gram...
Nathan Stone: Great to hear, I am planning to throw a huge party for my daughter and to give everyone a good time I'm going to need a lot of it. We’re gonna party all night and I want this to last.
Employee: Glad to hear it... I will caution you that some parents really don't like this stuff and don't want their kids anywhere near it...
Nathan Stone: Doesn't matter to me, what's the harm in a little glitter!
