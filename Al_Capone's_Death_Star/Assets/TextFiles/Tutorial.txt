Al "Pine" Cone: Who knows, in the future I may be saying a whole lot of incriminating, crucial, information.
Acron Gnut: Let me join in as well.
Al "Pine" Cone: I will. Donâ€™t worry.
Acron Gnut: Good. Most conversations are between two people and will go back and forth like this.
Al "Pine" Cone: Dont worry if you can't remember everything, in the upper right hand corner there is your handy log book.
Acron Gnut: The logbook will only record the parts of the conversation you listen to so keep that in mind
Al "Pine" Cone: You will need to search through the conversations to find clues to my plot.
Acron Gnut: A call at the end of the day will put your information gathering to the test.
Al "Pine" Cone: Good Luck and let the game begin.
