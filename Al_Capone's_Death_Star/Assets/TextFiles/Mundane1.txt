Jeremy Fir: Oh honey I won it big at the casino!!!
Shellby Fir: That’s amazing, now we can pay off the loans that you took out!
Jeremy Fir: And just one more win and we can send our kid to college!
Shellby Fir: Jeremy…
Jeremy Fir: And just one more win after that and we will be eating steak dinners for the rest of our lives! I am feeling lucky today and we shouldn't miss this life changing opportunity.
Shellby Fir: Jeremy! Think of our child! Just take the money that you have and come home! I haven't seen you in so long…
Jeremy Fir: Shellby, this is why we are broke! You are too afraid to take risks and make the big bucks, and I was too… but not today! I am going back to the casino!
