"Billy the Chuckling": We have a proposition for you.
Frank Piney: I’m listening.
"Billy the Chuckling": We have arranged a meeting tonight. We need you to stay out of the way for the duration of our work.
Frank Piney: What’s in it for us?
"Billy the Chuckling": We are prepared to offer you a great sum of money for your cooperation.
Frank Piney: How much are we talking?
"Billy the Chuckling": A month’s income for your whole office.
Frank Piney: How generous. I’m interested.
"Billy the Chuckling": We give you half of it up front, half of it once we’re done.
Frank Piney: What do we have to do?
"Billy the Chuckling": Stay out of the warehouse district in general around midnight. Especially stay away from unit five. We’ll be there for only a brief time. You might hear gunshots. This is expected. Do not pursue any vehicles leaving the scene.
Frank Piney: What are you doing there? Why is it worth so much?
"Billy the Chuckling": We’re putting an end to Acron Gnut’s control over this city. It’s mutually beneficial. The Monax has been the site of many of our turf wars, since it’s in between our two main locations. This would stop the violence, making a lot less work for you.
Frank Piney: I like that idea. If this works, you get full control of the city. I hope our cooperation tonight is the start of a strong working relationship between our two organizations.
