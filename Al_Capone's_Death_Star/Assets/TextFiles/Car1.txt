Jerry Silflay: I need you to steal a car.
Louis Boone: That’s what I do best. What are you looking for?
Jerry Silflay: We need at least four seats and something that doesn’t attract too much heat for sitting on the street. Ideally something no one will miss for one night.
Louis Boone: I’ll find something.
Jerry Silflay: Once you get it, hand it off to Golff "Ace" Caddy and call me.
Louis Boone: You’ll hear from me as soon as I make the handoff.
