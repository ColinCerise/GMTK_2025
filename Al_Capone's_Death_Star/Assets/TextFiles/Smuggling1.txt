Tony Whiskers: I need you to smuggle two guns into the storage unit where the alliance meeting is tonight.
"Kyle": Sure. Unit 13, right? I can make that happen. Aren’t they doing a sweep though to check for that kind of thing? I can’t promise they won’t be found.
Tony Whiskers: Yes. Don’t worry, we’ve got that covered.
"Kyle": Alright. I’ll get going on that.
Tony Whiskers: Report back to base when you’re done. Call me from there.
"Kyle": I’ll get back to you in a couple hours.
