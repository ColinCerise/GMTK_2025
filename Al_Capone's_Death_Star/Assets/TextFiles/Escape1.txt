Joey Smalltail: I need you to drive tonight.
Golf "Ace" Caddy: Where to?
Joey Smalltail: I need a getaway driver, and you’re the best we’ve got on hand.
Golf "Ace" Caddy: I know.
Joey Smalltail: What I don’t need is that attitude. Can you do it or not?
Golf "Ace" Caddy: I can do it.
Joey Smalltail: Great. Get to Eastburrow and wait until we can get you a car. Then head to Thickwood. Once you get the car, drive to Thickwood, where I’ll contact you.
Golf "Ace" Caddy: I’ll be waiting.
