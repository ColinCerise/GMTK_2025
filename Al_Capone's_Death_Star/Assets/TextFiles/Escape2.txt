Joey Smalltail: I heard you procured a car. Is everything in order?
Golff "Ace" Caddy: Yes, quite. This is a lovely vehicle, matches the description you provided perfectly. New coat of blue paint and everything. It should do nicely for the job. What exactly do you have in mind?
Joey Smalltail: They will be unarmed. The garage door will open. You drive in, pick up the three people inside, and escape back to Eastburrow, where you’ll dump the car with Louis Boone and get back to base for the night in one of our vehicles.
Golff "Ace" Caddy: How much heat do you expect on my tail?
Joey Smalltail: After the gunshots go off, I expect some kind of pursuit, but they’re not ready for this. I’m sure you’ll be fine.
Golff "Ace" Caddy: I’ll scamper out of there as quickly as I can regardless.
Joey Smalltail: Your cowardice makes you perfect for this job.
Golff "Ace" Caddy: Thank you?
