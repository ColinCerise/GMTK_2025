Tony Whiskers: We have the guns planted in the warehouse.
Crag "One-Eye": Where can we find them?
Tony Whiskers: They’re sitting by the garage door where you’ll enter, hidden in some boxes.
Crag "One-Eye": How are we supposed to find which boxes these things are in?
Tony Whiskers: They’re unarmed. They won’t put up much of a fight. Just get it done.
Crag "One-Eye": Understood.
