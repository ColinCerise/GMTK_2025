Al "Pine" Cone: We still on for tonight?
Acron Gnut: As long as you hold up your end of the deal.
Al "Pine" Cone: I will. Don’t worry.
Acron Gnut: Good. I’ll be there with my second. No weapons. I’ll have someone check you at the door. I expect you’ll do the same.
Al "Pine" Cone: Of course. I would expect nothing less.
Acron Gnut: I hope this is a long and prosperous alliance for us both.
Al "Pine" Cone: I’ll see you there.
