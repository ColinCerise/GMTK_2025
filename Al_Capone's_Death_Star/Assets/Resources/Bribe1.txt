Plumpen Tumac: I need you to make a bribe to The Monax police force.
"Billy the Chuckling": How much and for what?
Plumpen Tumac: This is important. You have the full coffers of our organization. We need to get The Monax police force off our backs for tonight.
"Billy the Chuckling": I’ll make it happen. How accurate do you want the information to be?
Plumpen Tumac: Give them a nearby location. A different warehouse should do the trick. If the bribe works, The Monax police force wiil be out of the general area. If it doesn’t, they’ll be in the wrong place and we can see them coming.
"Billy the Chuckling": I’ll get on it right away.
