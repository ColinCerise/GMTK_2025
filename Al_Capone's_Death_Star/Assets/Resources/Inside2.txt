Jimmy Oakleaf: I have more information for you.
"Phil Potatoes": I’m ready.
Jimmy Oakleaf: A getaway driver will be waiting outside the building in a blue car with an eagle-shaped hood ornament. Be there by ten past midnight or you’ll be left behind.
"Phil Potatoes": Alright. You got any other information for me?
Jimmy Oakleaf: You’re sure that the Al "Pine" Cone trusts you?
"Phil Potatoes": Of course. I’ve been deep undercover for months. I’m about to check the room for hidden weapons. I’ll help your agent ensure the guns are well-concealed.
Jimmy Oakleaf: Perfect. They’re stored in the containers by the garage door.
"Phil Potatoes": I’ll make sure they remain hidden. You won’t be getting any problems from me.
