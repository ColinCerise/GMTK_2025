Jimmy Oakleaf: Are you still with us?
"Phil Potatoes": Yes. You don’t need to worry about me. I’ll follow through.
Jimmy Oakleaf: Are you in position for tonight?
"Phil Potatoes": Yes. I’ve been selected to check the location and Al "Pine" Cone for weapons.
Jimmy Oakleaf: Excellent. All your hard work is paying off. All the pieces are falling into place just as intended.
"Phil Potatoes": I’m happy to be of service. I hope it all pays off. We can finally take down the tyrant and run this town all on our own.
Jimmy Oakleaf: I look forward to that day. I’ll update you later this evening with more information on what exactly we need you to do. This is essential information, so stand by for my call.
"Phil Potatoes": I’ll be waiting.
